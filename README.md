EDA, modeling, and evaluation project applying classifiers or regressors on a chosen dataset Explore, predict and analyze with accuracy.
For this lecture we will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle/github. This is a very famous data set andvery often is a student's first step in machine learning!
We'll be trying to predict a classification-survival or deceased Let's begin our understanding of implementing LogisticRegression in Python for classification.
We'll use a "semi-cleaned version of the titanic data set if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.
